# Hyper-Parameter-Optimization-in-Training
Using Pytorch and CIFAR10 dataset to experiment the optimal hyper parameter setting during machine learning

CIFAR10 is a wide-used dataset for deep learning. In this project, I implemented a standard deep learning model with 13 layers, including 3 dropout layers, 9 convolutional layers and 1 maximum pooling.
Then I examine the best hyperparameter setting (weight decay, momentum, regularization term)
